# Notes & Brainstorming

- Filter out DLC (and possibly games with 0 players).
- Search for specific game.
- Filter by multiplayer games?
- Create a session when the user searches for a specific player, giving an option similar to "not PLAYER_NAME?" to "logout"/clear the session, so they don't need to search for the user every time. OR even better, offer a checkbox to remember (to start a session) if checked when searching / accessing a player's game library.
- Error/flash messages for:
  - private users
  - when the API fails
  - something went wrong
- Maybe try and make a unique 404 page? That'd be cool...

Name Brainstorm for Site:
How Many Steam Players?
Player Count
Steam Player Count
Steam Library Player Count
How Active is My Steam Library?

... All of these are pretty lame.
- Should probably have 'Steam' in the name.

REMINDERS:
- Need to mention "Powered by Steam" if using Steam API.
  - Read all the Terms of Use for the Steam API (make sure there isn't anything else I'm missing).
