# Break Project - Brandi Wilson

In this project I will be making a small website that uses the Steam API to combine a user's list of games with the amount of players currently in a game and display them on a single page.
- This is the minimum viable product.
- You will have to enter your username manually, as Steam does not have an OAuth system for the general public. (At least, it doesn't seem to from my current research.)
- Beyond the minimum viable product, I would like to either:
  - Expand functionality, allowing you to filter/sort/search results.
    - Specifically filter/organize by multiplayer games.
  - Experiment with JavaScript & styling.

- What is the goal of the project?
  - Create a webpage that allows an anonymous user to search for a non-private player and see a list of all games in their library and the currently amount of players playing the game. (Also, create something that I might use on occasion.)
  - Compound and combine all the knowledge I have built up over the past months.
  - Work with the Steam API.
- Who is the target audience (can be just yourself)?
  - MYSELF
  - And anyone who is interested in seeing the population of the games in their library all in one place.
- What are your personal learning goals?
  -
- What technologies/frameworks/patterns will you be employing?
  - HTML (Obviously.)
  - CSS (I may try and not use Bootstrap.)
  - Ruby on Rails
  - JavaScript
  - jQuery
  - rspec
  - TDD
- What are the tech and/or skill dependencies of your project?
  - Steam API
  - I'm unsure of all the gems I'll be using, but probably:
    - HTTParty
    - VCR
    - Better Errors
- What does success look like for this project? What does done mean?
  - It looks glorious--I mean, the site works, fulfills it's intended purpose, and is bug-free (to my knowledge).
  - Minimum viable product achieved + the site looks presentable.
